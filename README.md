## target:
#### Use TensorFlow (or any tool you prefer) to recognize between two classes of objects.  These classes could be:
#### Cars and Trucks or Cars and SUVs
#### Roses and Sunflowers or Vegetables
#### You need to capture the images yourself and tag them.  You can use any Tagging system (e.g, https://hubs.ly/H0dktLv0 Neurala).  You #### need to design your own Training, Testing and Verification sets.
#### You need to compare between two different systems based on the literature review you did and/or reading material provided
#### Bonus:  Provide an API with example code for another developer to use your system


## Steps
### First step
#### download the pictures from the internet(Google Database)
#### label the pictures

### Second step
#### use the vgg19 model which is used in airbus ship detection project to do transfer learning 
#### I just need to change the input pictures path and the final layers of the model to train the model.
